Scott's contributions in the lab existed mainly in the realm of back-end web development within the Django framework. He worked on all levels of the software development stack and was taking on tasks wherever needed. He started his early web development days on the front-end, but a love of Python, and introductions to things like Django and Flask quickly changed his mind.
