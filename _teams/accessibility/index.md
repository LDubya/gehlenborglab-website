blurb: HIDIVE Lab Accessibility Research Team.

Digital barriers ranging from inaccessible biomedical data platforms to inaccessible biomedical data visualization tools obstruct the entry and active participation of people with certain visual, cognitive, and physical disabilities in biomedical research, limit the field of biomedicine, and contribute to societal inequities. Our current accessibility research endeavors in the HIDIVE lab aim to dismantle these barriers by enhancing the digital accessibility of biomedical data visualizations for people of various disabilities, as well as contributing to the accessibility of biomedical research journals and data portals. We are committed to contributing to the removal of the digital accessibility barriers that hinder the full participation of humans with disabilities in biomedical data integration, visualization, and exploration.
