Welcome to our website, where we delve into our unwavering commitment to advancing accessibility in biomedical research, with a special emphasis on individuals with visual impairments. While acknowledging various types of impairments, our focus remains keen on addressing the challenges that hinder the full participation of visually impaired individuals in the biomedical community. The limited involvement of these individuals, underscored by stark statistics, has significant implications for the field, illuminating the broader hurdles in making biomedical data comprehensively accessible. These barriers, ranging from inaccessible digital platforms to the unavailability of data in formats suitable for the visually impaired, obstruct their entry and active participation in biomedical research. Our current research endeavors aim to dismantle these obstacles by enhancing the digital accessibility of biomedical research journals and data portals.
