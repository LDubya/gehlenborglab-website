image_alt: A figure of three images, A, B, and C, showing the drag-and-drop functionality in OpenKeyNav demonstrated in Voyager 2. (A) After OpenKeyNav’s drag mode is initiated through a shortcut key, the elements that can be dragged (Voyager’s data fields or “pills” in this case) are outlined and assigned shortcut key labels. Pressing the corresponding key, e.g., “d” for Major_Genre (indicated with a black rectangle) selects the element to be dragged. (B) Shelves where the element can be dropped are then assigned shortcut key labels and outlined. An element can be dropped by pressing the corresponding key, e.g., “a” for the x-axis (indicated with a black rectangle). (C) After a shelf is selected, the pill is dropped on it.

## **Overview**
Data visualization tools often rely heavily on mouse-based interactions, which can present significant accessibility barriers for individuals navigating with keyboards. This challenge disproportionately impacts users with motor disabilities, who may find it difficult or impossible to interact with tools designed primarily for mouse input. To address these barriers, our research explored how keyboard-driven interactions can enhance the accessibility of data visualization tools. A key part of this effort is the preprint *Using OpenKeyNav to Enhance the Keyboard-Accessibility of Web-based Data Visualization Tools*, which was presented at the AccessViz workshop at IEEE VIS 2024. This paper investigates how OpenKeyNav, an open-source javascript-based keyboard navigation library library, enables complex keyboard interactions like drag-and-drop for web-based data visualization platforms.

## **Challenges in Keyboard Accessibility**
Data visualization tools typically require the use of a mouse for essential interactions, such as drag-and-drop operations, which are difficult or impossible for users relying on keyboard navigation. These barriers limit participation in the field of data visualization and prevent individuals with motor impairments from fully engaging in education, research, and professional opportunities, further contributing to societal inequities. 

## **Research Focus**
The preprint *Using OpenKeyNav to Enhance the Keyboard-Accessibility of Web-based Data Visualization Tools* introduces a novel method for keyboard-driven drag-and-drop interactions. OpenKeyNav dynamically generates keyboard shortcuts that allow users to perform complex tasks, such as moving data fields within a Tableau-like interface, without relying on a mouse. The research outlines how this solution provides an equivalent user experience for both keyboard and mouse users, aligning with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

## **Key Findings**
- **Keyboard-Accessible Drag-and-Drop in Voyager**: OpenKeyNav enables users to drag and drop data fields within Voyager 2, an open source data visualization tool with an interface similar to tableau. These data fields are moved through just-in-time keyboard shortcuts generated by OpenKeyNav. This method allows keyboard users to perform the same complex interactions that would otherwise require a mouse, making the data visualization tool more accessible for a wider range of users.
- **Equivalent Interaction Experience**: The solution addresses the disparity in time and effort typically imposed on keyboard users by providing an experience that closely mirrors the efficiency of mouse interactions. The keyboard interface eliminates the need to tab through multiple elements, significantly reducing the time burden on users.
- **Supporting WCAG Compliance**: This research demonstrates how OpenKeyNav helps developers meet WCAG 2.1 guidelines for keyboard accessibility, enabling a more inclusive user experience for data visualization platforms.

## **Ongoing Research and Collaboration**
This work contributes to our lab's ongoing efforts to improve accessibility in biomedical data visualization. By integrating solutions like OpenKeyNav into data visualization tools, we aim to reduce barriers to access and participation for users with disabilities. We are actively exploring opportunities for further collaboration to enhance the inclusivity of data visualization tools.
