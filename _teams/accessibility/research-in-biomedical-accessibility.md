image_alt: A figure containing three graphs. Graph A shows that 96% of data portals have issues. Graph B shows the percentage of those issues by accessibility categories, with contrast being the most prevalent issue, and label_missing, alt_missing, and label_empty highlighted. Graph C is a pie chart showing that 78.8% of alt text in journals are entirely missing, while 21.3% are uninformative.

## Evaluation of Accessibility in Biomedical Resources

Our lab been conducting extensive research evaluating the accessibility of biomedical websites and resources. In this ongoing project, we assessed over 3,000 biomedical data portals and journal websites using accessibility evaluation tools like [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org) and [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/).

## Current Accessibility Status
Our evaluation revealed that nearly all of the assessed websites (96%) had severe accessibility issues. The most common issue identified was the absence of crucial metadata, such as alternative text for images, which creates significant barriers for users with blindness and low vision (BLV). Without such metadata, it is impossible for BLV users to fully understand the content displayed in biomedical data visualizations (Refer to figure on the top).

## Research Aims
Our primary goal is to improve the accessibility of biomedical resources by identifying the key barriers and developing strategies to address them. Through this work, we aim to ensure that biomedical websites and tools comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and are accessible to people with disabilities.

## Our Contributions
- **Evaluation Results**: We identified a range of accessibility failures, with missing alt texts being one of the most prevalent issues.
- **Tools Used**: We employed computational accessibility tools such as WAVE and Axe to conduct our analysis.
- **Addressing Gaps**: Our findings highlight the need for improving accessibility across biomedical websites, particularly in providing alternative texts and complying with WCAG.

## Call to Action
We invite you to participate in this effort. We are looking for feedback and suggestions from the broader scientific and accessibility communities and potential collaborations for academic and non-academic activities.
