<!-- Every web interface should be accessible, but inaccessible web experiences are the norm. -->


When the HIDIVE lab began our accessibility research,
little was known about the state of accessibility of biomedical resources.

[ we can mention early collaborators here]

Recognizing the under-representation of people with disabilities in the biomedical sciences,
<!-- , the HIDIVE lab began our accessibility research.  -->
<!-- Little was known about the accessibility of biomedical resources, so  -->
we started by quantifying the state accessibility of research journals and data portals, crucial for biomedical research, in a project led by {% include get-name-degree.html name="Sehi L'Yi" %}.
<!-- This research is ongoing, and detailed in the preprint [ preprint ].  -->

We continued by exploring new ways to make biomedical data visualizations accessible for people who are blind or have low vision (BLV). 

Responding to a need for improved screen reader accessibility of data visualizations, {% include get-name-degree.html name="Thomas Smits" %}' 
AltGosling project automates description generation of genome-mapped data visualizations created with the grammar-based genomics toolkit Gosling.

As our accessibility team grew, we began making accessibility remediations to our website while preparing to share our publications and other initiatives. In addition to usability improvements, to better-conform to WCAG 2.1 level AA, the lab made a concerted effort to add alt text to over 100 of the lab website's images, aiming for full alt text coverage throughout the site.

{% include get-name-degree.html name="Sofia Rojas" %} and {% include get-name-degree.html name="Andrew Mar" %} joined the lab as Research Assistants, contributing to several of the team's projects. {% include get-name-degree.html name="Sofia Rojas" %} also began exploring a capstone project in the accessibility space. {% include get-name-degree.html name="Andrew Mar" %}'s contributions include essential perspectives in the paper *Explaining Unfamiliar Genomics Data Visualizations to a Blind Individual through Transitions*, which was accepted for presentation at the AccessViz workshop at IEEE VIS 2024. 

We also explore new ways to make biomedical data visualizations accessible for people with a wide range of disabilities. The preprint *Using OpenKeyNav to Enhance the Keyboard-Accessibility of Web-based Data Visualization Tools*, based on an open-source software library by {% include get-name-degree.html name="Lawrence Weru" %}, explores how to improve the keyboard accessibility of web-based data visualization tools through automated, on-demand keyboard shortcuts for complex actions such as drag and drop. 
The preprint was accepted for presentation at the AccessViz workshop at IEEE VIS 2024.

As our journey continues, we remain dedicated to pushing the boundaries of accessibility in biomedical research and beyond. Stay tuned for our latest projects and publications as we work towards a more inclusive scientific community.
