<!-- Every web interface should be accessible, but inaccessible web experiences are the norm. -->

When the HIDIVE lab began our accessibility research, we first focused on improving screen reader accessibility for data visualizations. 
Recognizing that grammar-based visualization tools like the Gosling toolkit could be converted into meaningful text descriptions, {% include get-name-degree.html title="Thomas Smits" %} led the AltGosling project to automate description generation for genome-mapped data visualizations.

Recognizing the under-representation of people with disabilities in the biomedical sciences,
we began quantifying the state accessibility of research journals and data portals, crucial for biomedical research, in a project led by {% include get-name-degree.html title="Sehi L'Yi" %}.

We began making remediations to our website to better conform to WCAG 2.1 level AA. This included adding alt text to over 100 images and ensuring accessible navigation throughout the site.

{% include get-name-degree.html title="Sofia Rojas" %} and {% include get-name-degree.html title="Andrew Mar" %} joined the lab as Research Assistants, contributing to several of the team's projects. 
{% include get-name-degree.html title="Andrew Mar" %}'s contributions were instrumental in the paper *Explaining Unfamiliar Genomics Data Visualizations to a Blind Individual through Transitions*, which was accepted for presentation at the AccessViz workshop at IEEE VIS 2024. 

We continue to explore ways to make biomedical data visualizations accessible for people with a wideer range of disabilities. 
The preprint *Using OpenKeyNav to Enhance the Keyboard-Accessibility of Web-based Data Visualization Tools*, based on an open-source software library by {% include get-name-degree.html title="Lawrence Weru" %}, explores how to improve the keyboard accessibility of web-based data visualization tools for people with motor disabilities.
The preprint was accepted for presentation at the AccessViz workshop at IEEE VIS 2024.

As our journey continues, we remain dedicated to pushing the boundaries of accessibility in the biomedical sciences. 
Stay tuned for our latest projects and publications as we work towards a more inclusive scientific community.
